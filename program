3. To Rename a Column name:-
SYNTAX:
	Alter table_name
	Rename Column existing_column_name to New_column_name;

EXAMPLE:
If we have a table called "students" with columns "student_id", "student_name" and "ph_no", 
we can use the following SQL query to Rename a Column name from the "ph_no" to "Contact_no" :
	Alter table student
	Rename column ph_no to Contact_no;

6. Remove duplicate from table:-
SYNTAX:
	Select Distinct column_name
	From table_name;

EXAMPLE: 
If we have a table called "employees" with columns "emlployee_id" and "emlployee_name", 
we can use the following SQL query to remove duplicates from the "emlployee_name" column:
	Select Distinct emlployee_name
	From emlployees;
